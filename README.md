Advance Web Mapping Project 1
Creator: Joshua AL Rasbi
Date: 12/11/23

The app in essense is a community build recording system based on crime incidents or hostile activity happening around the world.
Users are able to log these activities - around the world. The activity is then shown to users on the app.

The main idea is to provide people with a clearer people of places that are deemed as hostile and perhaps should be seen as a warning for people entering a certain area.

The project includes the following architecture:

- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- Database management: PgAdmin4
- Middle tier(s): Django
- Front-end: Bootstrap v5
- Mapping: Leaflet JS with OpenStreetMap
- Deployment (middle tier(s) & database): Docker, images for your components (Django, PostGIS, PgAdmin4, Nginx)
- Cloud-facing VM: MS Azure
- Domain name registered with a registrar: Registered on Godaddy.com

A digital certificate from a Certificate Authority.
